# ydl-tkinter

Youtube-Downloader made up in python with [tkinter](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tkinter).

## How it works

Just add your directory and url out of Youtube. Your path has to be full-path ending with \ or /.
You can not duplicate your downloads, ydl-tkinter will check for.
Do not overstrain your GUI while downloading.


## Note

You need to download [ffmpeg (ffprobe/avprobe and ffmpeg/avconv)](https://github.com/FFmpeg/FFmpeg) as a requirement.
